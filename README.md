# Red Wine Data Exploration

This project is a part of the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

-- Project Status: Completed

## Project Introduction

Exploring the red wine dataset to detect most of the expected relationships, find the most interesting feature and analyze it across all the other variables to understand the impact of the variables on it.

## Methods Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization

## Technologies

- R
- HTML

## Project Description

I began with exploring the structure of tha data set. Then I applied univariate analysis to understand the nature of each feature. After that, I used bivariate and multivariate analysis to detect the expected relationships. (for more details see this [documentation](https://github.com/eng-dtarek/Red_Wine_Data_Exploration/blob/master/red-wine-data-exploration.html))


## Reflection

The Red Wine data set contains 1599 observations of 15 features including quality feature that is my interesting feature. I explored the quality across all the other features to understand the impact of the features on it.

The results showed that the main features affecting the quality are alcohol and acids. There is also other features that have a low impact like sulphates, density and pH.
